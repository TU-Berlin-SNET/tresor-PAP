	<description>
		The Stool Sample Service (S3) provides the results of samples, which were sent 
		and analysed by our participating partner laboratories. Our archive provides a patient's stool sample history to
		to detect hints for possible diseases early. Other hospitals can be authorized and granted access to
		the results to enhance cooperation. To preserve privacy a stool sample is never linked to a patient directly.
		Stool samples of the same subject are linked against earch other to express that two or many samples belong to
		a specific subject. By authorizing another hospital the access-granting party is in charge to ensure the access-granted party
		refers the results to the respective subject. Further the service provides details about laboratories.
