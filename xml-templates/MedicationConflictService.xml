		The Medication Conflict Service (MCS) disposes of an always up to date database of medicaments 
		and conflicts occurring by simultaneous administration. The MCS searches for conflicts in a given list of medicaments
		and proposes alternatives if such were detected. 
		The MCS does not need any patient information neither will the service store any information you submitted.
